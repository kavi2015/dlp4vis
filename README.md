# dlp4vis
Deep Learning Project for Vision Science

Tasks for our milestone (finish by 11/11 so can write report by 11/13):

(1) basic 3-block CNN (+ residual connections) - Kavi

(2) Keras VGG + Random Forest (need to work on random forest) - Daniel

(3) Attention based classification using UNET or Class Activation Maps or Grad CAMs (papers attached) - Chelsea, Kavi, Daniel

(4) Multimodal input images (RNFL probability maps + RGCP probability maps) - Kavi (and Chelsea and Daniel)

(5) Pytorch AlexNet + Random Forest if time and if #2 does not help increase accuracy - Kavi, Chelsea, Daniel

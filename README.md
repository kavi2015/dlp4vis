Deep Learning Project for Vision Science

Tasks for final report (early December):

(1) Optimize attention based classification using UNET or Class Activation Maps or Grad CAMs (or Keras), and create activation maps for CNN B (pre-trained VGG + Random Forest Classifier)

(2) Test CNN B on Early Glaucoma Dataset; possibly obtain fine-grained labels to re-train both models

(3) Try simpler models to achieve higher accuracy; try more datasets; try multi-modal images

(4) Compute AUC of ROC curves, try out PPV/other accuracy metrics

Note: Keras ImageDataGenerator code based on code from "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet, Section 5.3.1
Note: CNN A based on https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html
